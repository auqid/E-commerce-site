# Project

Implement the Fake Store REST API and essentially create a user interface for it using
React JS.
Redux to create a global state container.
React Router for client side routing.
UI for Products CRUD operations that the given API exposes.
User Authentication System (Login Only).
CART page (showing all products in cart) and the logged in User
must have the option to add / remove products from there. Products can be added
to cart from the Products page and deleted from the CART page.
version contro (GIT) and hosted the repository on Github.

Optional features:
A nicely designed and easy to use UI is welcome.
Use of Duck pattern for Redux would be great.
Creating UI for additional endpoints such as categories, sorting, pagination would be a bonus (but not mandatory).
